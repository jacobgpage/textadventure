Finished: April 10, 2020

A Legend of Zelda text adventure game created for my Lab 3 for Computer Science 2 class!

Code will work with any file built the same way! The file must be named "GameInput.csv" and must use the below format!

ID = Number of Prompt, Prompt Text and Response are just characters, and Response ID is the ID of the prompt that the Response leads too.

ID|Prompt Text|Response|Response ID|Response|Response ID|Response|Response ID|

___________________________________________________________
|A winning path chose: 1 > 1 > 2 > 0 > 2 > 1 > 0 > 0 > Win!|
|A losing path chose: 0 > Lose!                            |
